<analysis>
The previous AI engineer began by creating an Ecuador Delivery App based on an initial product description. The development trajectory was iterative, marked by persistent challenges with  animations and web compatibility, leading to repeated user complaints about crashes and broken features despite the AI's claims of success. The AI engineer attempted multiple fixes, including simplifying the animation approach and ultimately rewriting core frontend authentication and internationalization to resolve these issues. Key milestones included establishing a backend with FastAPI/MongoDB, implementing multi-language support (ES, EN, RU), and integrating Google OAuth. The AI successfully seeded a product catalog and enabled anonymous browsing. However, after extensive back-and-forth debugging and feature implementation, the user provided an entirely new, detailed product requirement for a MegaBodega Delivery App. The AI has just begun this new task, setting up its basic structure and internationalization.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was for an Ecuador Delivery App featuring a modern UI, product catalog, cart, checkout, online payment (Google Pay, Apple Pay, cards), push notifications, multi-language (ES, EN, RU), and an admin panel. Specific exclusions included bonus/loyalty systems. The app was to be simple, modern, and ready for app stores. The AI implemented a multi-language system, basic authentication (including Google OAuth), and a seeded product catalog.

The new product requirement is for MegaBodega Delivery App with maximum fluidity and UX. It encompasses: Google login, multi-language (ES, EN, RU) with a language switcher on the main page, smooth animations and modern UI/UX, Stripe payments, distinct user roles (Client, Courier, Shop Staff) with tailored screens and functionalities (e.g., map for courier, product/order management for shop staff), push notifications, secure data storage, and an easy admin panel. Technical requirements specify iOS/Android cross-platform support, screen compatibility, optimized performance, and minimal bugs on older devices. The UI/UX style is described as minimalistic, modern, light craft-style, with clear navigation.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: Expo, React Native, Expo Router (file-based routing), React Navigation, i18next (multi-language), React Hook Form, Zustand (state management), AsyncStorage (persistence).  was initially used but largely removed due to web compatibility issues.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (for data storage), PyMongo, Pydantic, JWT (authentication), Python-dotenv, google-auth-oauthlib (Google OAuth).
- **Integrations**: Stripe (payment gateway, backend setup), Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM for notifications, structure prepared), Google OAuth.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project has a monorepo structure with  and  directories.



-   : FastAPI application entry point, defines API routes for users, authentication (login, register, Google OAuth), products, and orders.
-   : Defines Pydantic/MongoDB models for User (Client, Store, Courier roles), Product, Order.
-   : Handles MongoDB connection and utility functions.
-   : Script to populate the database with initial product data.
-   : The main entry point and welcome screen, now includes language selection, authentication buttons, and a link to the product catalog.
-   , : User authentication screens, supporting email/password and Google OAuth.
-   : Displays the product catalog, accessible without authentication.
-   , , : Core files for multi-language support and the language selection UI.
-   : Provides React Context for global authentication state management.
-   : Reusable component for Google sign-in.
-   : Expo configuration file, currently being updated for the new MegaBodega app.
-   , , , : Newly created files for the MegaBodega Delivery App to establish new i18n and splash screen.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
From the *original* Ecuador Delivery App plan, before the new request:
- Full Stripe payment integration (beyond backend setup).
- Complete push notification implementation (FCM).
- Full Admin/Courier panel functionalities.
- Cart and Checkout system beyond basic setup.
- Bonus system, discounts, and loyalty programs (though explicitly excluded initially, the new request might reintroduce related concepts).

From the *new* MegaBodega Delivery App plan:
- Implement splash screen animation.
- Develop all specific screens for Client, Courier, and Shop Staff roles.
- Integrate Stripe payments for products.
- Configure and send notifications.
- Implement advanced animations and transitions.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer has transitioned from the Ecuador Delivery App to a new project: MegaBodega Delivery App. Immediately before this summary, the AI was initiating the setup for this new application. It has created new foundational files for the MegaBodega app:  (being modified for new app details), , , , , and . The purpose of these files is to establish the basic app structure, a new multi-language system specific to MegaBodega, and a splash screen as requested. The latest action indicates it's currently fixing  and installing necessary dependencies to proceed with this new project.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to correctly fix  and install the missing dependencies for the new MegaBodega Delivery App project.
