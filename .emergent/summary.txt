This trajectory details the work of an AI engineer (referred to as you in the prompt) who inherited a partially developed Ecuador Delivery App project, which was then transitioned to a new MegaBodega Delivery App as per a new set of product requirements. The initial state described a project that had struggled with  and web compatibility, but had established a FastAPI/MongoDB backend, multi-language support (ES, EN, RU), Google OAuth, and a seeded product catalog.

The current AI engineer's work began by taking over the MegaBodega Delivery App task. The initial efforts focused on setting up the basic structure and internationalization, which led to debugging persistent Ngrok tunnel issues preventing the frontend from starting and being accessible via Expo Go. After resolving connectivity and environmental issues (like file watch limits and Hermes compiler conflicts), the engineer delivered a basic UI. The user then highlighted significant functional gaps: non-working cart, authentication, product catalog, categories, payments, and poor translations.

The engineer systematically addressed these by implementing full authentication (email/password, Google OAuth), a cart system, an API service, Stripe payment integration (both frontend and backend), and comprehensive translation updates, including a backend script to seed products with improved multi-language descriptions. Multiple rounds of frontend debugging were required to fix import paths and Metro bundler cache issues, eventually leading to a fully functional web application preview with a dynamic product catalog, working cart, and language switcher.

The work culminated in a robust web-based delivery app. However, the user then provided a completely new, extensive request: to clone the Perekrestok delivery app, integrating all previous MegaBodega requirements, specifying the delivery city as Ba単os de Agua Santa, dark/light themes, and a managed invitation system for courier/admin registrations. The engineer immediately began this new task by initiating backend development for the invitation system.

<product_requirements>
The initial project was an Ecuador Delivery App with a modern UI, product catalog, cart, checkout, online payment (Google Pay, Apple Pay, cards), push notifications, multi-language (ES, EN, RU), and an admin panel, excluding bonus/loyalty systems.

The subsequent and primary requirement was for a MegaBodega Delivery App, emphasizing maximum fluidity and UX. This included: Google login, multi-language (ES, EN, RU) with a main page switcher, smooth animations, modern UI/UX, Stripe payments, distinct user roles (Client, Courier, Shop Staff) with tailored screens, push notifications, secure data storage, and an easy admin panel. Technical needs covered iOS/Android cross-platform support, screen compatibility, optimized performance, and minimal bugs on older devices, all with a minimalistic, modern, light craft-style UI.

The latest request is to create a clone of the Perekrestok delivery app, incorporating all existing MegaBodega requirements. Specific additions include:
-   No discount system.
-   Delivery exclusively in Ba単os de Agua Santa (Ecuador).
-   Both dark and light themes.
-   A managed registration process for Courier and Shop Staff roles (requiring creation by the app owner/creator).
-   High-quality translations and product descriptions.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: Expo, React Native, Expo Router (file-based routing), React Navigation, i18next, React Hook Form, Zustand (state management), AsyncStorage, ,  (initially problematic).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB, PyMongo, Pydantic, JWT (authentication), Python-dotenv, google-auth-oauthlib, Stripe (payment gateway).
-   **Integrations**: Google OAuth, Stripe,  for Stripe, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM, prepared structure).

<pending_tasks>
-   Full Stripe payment integration (frontend and backend are set up, but end-to-end testing and UI/UX polish are needed).
-   Complete push notification implementation (FCM).
-   Develop full functionalities for Client, Courier, and Shop Staff role-specific screens.
-   Implement the Perekrestok clone requirements, specifically:
    -   City-based filtering/selection for Ba単os de Agua Santa.
    -   Dark and light theme implementation.
    -   Completion of the invitation-based registration system for Courier and Shop Staff.
    -   Ensure all translations, especially product descriptions, are high quality and comprehensive.
-   Develop the missing additional menu for account management and profile changes.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just received a new, significant product requirement to create a clone of the Perekrestok delivery app, while integrating all previously established MegaBodega features (branding, multi-language, roles, modern UI/UX). The user further specified that there should be no discount system, delivery should be restricted to Ba単os de Agua Santa, both dark and light themes are required, and a managed registration system (via invitation codes by the app creator) for Courier and Shop Staff roles. High-quality translations and product descriptions are also explicitly requested.

Immediately following this new request, the AI engineer has begun implementing the core of the new role management system. This involves creating new backend files:
-   : This file is intended to manage the generation, storage, and validation of invitation codes that will be used for Courier and Shop Staff registrations.
-   : This file will likely be updated to include Pydantic models for invitation codes and potentially modified user registration schemas to incorporate these codes.
-   : This file will also need updates to its MongoDB models, specifically for User roles and potentially a new  model, to store and link invitation codes within the database.

The AI engineer's current action is to initialize this new backend invitation system, which is a foundational step towards fulfilling the requirement for managed role registration.

The next step is to initialize the new supermarket catalog and complete the invitation system for role-based registration.
